# Feature: A user can mark a task as done #29

Welcome to _TinyTasks_, the most basic task management app in the whole wide world - no fancy UI and a
very limited set of features. Fortunately, you are here to save the day and improve parts of _TinyTasks_.
Feel free to focus on a single feature or aspect of the application. You can find a list of open issues in
the [issue section](https://github.com/mindsmash/tiny-tasks/issues) of this repository.

## As a user, I want to mark tasks as done so that I can see which tasks have already been worked on.

#Acceptance criteria

#### the user can mark a task as done
#### the task list is sorted by done status
#### tasks that are not done go to the top of the list
#### tasks that are done go to the bottom of the list


#Optional acceptance criteria (IN TODO: not finished)

##### the user can clear the list of done tasks
#### the user can mark a task as done by drag & drop to the list of done tasks
#### the user can set the task status with more details ("In Progress", "Blocked", ...)
