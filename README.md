# TinyTasks

Welcome to _TinyTasks_, the most basic task management app in the whole wide world - no fancy UI and a
very limited set of features. Fortunately, you are here to save the day and improve parts of _TinyTasks_.
Feel free to focus on a single feature or aspect of the application. You can find a list of open issues in
the [issue section](https://github.com/mindsmash/tiny-tasks/issues) of this repository.

## Development

The application consists of a frontend and a backend. Both can be started separately. The frontend is
[Angular](https://angular.io/) based and the backend is based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

Before you can start developing you need to set up your development environment. You can find good and clear
instructions on the Angular website in the [Quickstart](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) guide. The
backend requires a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server that is provided by a
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. Thus, Docker is required. You can find the information you need to
set up the runtime environment on the Docker website under [Get Started](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Frontend

The fronted was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Run `yarn` to install the
dependencies for the app. You can also add new dependencies via `yarn add`. Run `yarn start` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To run the dev server without starting the backend use `yarn start-local`. The application will then store its
data in the browser's local storage instead of sending the data to the backend.

Run `yarn lint` to lint your application and `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Backend

The backend was generated with [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). Run `docker-compose up -d` to launch
the PostgreSQL docker container. Run `./gradlew bootRun` for a dev server. The server is available under `http://localhost:8080/`.

Run `./gradlew test` to execute the tests.
